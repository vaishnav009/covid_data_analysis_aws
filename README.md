# Covid Data Analysis Using AWS Cloud Services

## Introduction 
In this project, I have executed an End-To-End Data pipeline which reads data from AWS S3 bucket using AWS Glue Crawler and stores it into AWS Glue Data Catalog. Using AWS Glue Job, we perform some transformations on it and store the transformed data in Amazon Redshift.

We are going to use different technologies such as Python, AWS S3, AWS Glue Crawler, AWS Data Catalog, AWS Glue Jobs, Amazon Redshift.
